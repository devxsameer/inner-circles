# InnerCircles

### _Private communities. Real conversations. Public anonymity._

Node • Express • PostgreSQL • Passport • Tailwind

**InnerCircles** is a modern, community-based social platform where users can:

- Create and join private circles
- Post publicly or privately
- Reveal identities **only within their circles**
- Manage members with strict **role-based permissions**

It blends privacy, collaboration, and anonymity into a clean, simple user experience — making it a portfolio-grade full-stack project.

This project started as _The Odin Project – Members Only_ assignment, but evolved into a **full-featured, production-style web application** with real authorization rules, role-based permissions, and relational data integrity.

## 🚀 Live Preview

🔗 **Live App:**  
👉 [**https://innercircles.devxsameer.me/**](https://innercircles.devxsameer.me/)

Hosted on **Render** + **Neon PostgreSQL**.

> Note: First visit may take a few seconds if Render has spun down the instance.

## 🚀 Live Concept

> **See posts. Join circles. Speak freely.**
>
> In InnerCircles:
>
> - Anyone can read **public posts**
> - Only circle members can see **who wrote them**
> - Each circle governs its own members, roles, and content

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication

- Local auth using **Passport.js**
- Session-based login with PostgreSQL session store
- **Bcrypt** password hashing
- Rate-limited login endpoint (secure for production)

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Circles (Communities)

- Users can **create their own circles**
- Circle creator automatically becomes **owner**
- Role-based system:
  - **Owner** – full control
  - **Admin** – manage members & roles
  - **Member** – post and interact
- Owners & admins can:
  - Add members by username
  - Promote/demote members
  - Remove members (with strict rules)
- SQL triggers keep `members_count` up to date automatically

### 📝 Posts & Privacy

- Create, edit, and delete posts inside circles
- Visibility types:
  - `public`
  - `members_only`
- Identity reveal is circle-based:
  - Outside → **Anonymous**
  - Inside → **Real username**
- Pagination for all feeds

### 🛡 Authorization & Security

- Policy-based permission system
- Loader middlewares (`loadPost`, `loadCircle`, `loadMembership`)
- Separation of concerns:
  - **Routes → Controllers → Services → Models**
- Business rules enforced at:
  - Service layer
  - Database constraints
  - PostgreSQL triggers

### 📊 Performance & UX

- Pagination for posts and circles
- Popular circles ranked by member count
- Indexed queries for efficient lookups
- Clean, responsive UI using **Tailwind CSS**

### 🏠 Homepage

- Latest public posts
- Most popular circles
- Clean, Tailwind-powered design

## 🗄 Database Design

**Core tables**

- `users`
- `circles`
- `circle_members`
- `posts`

**Notable design choices**

- `members_count` cached on circles via PostgreSQL triggers
- Single owner enforced per circle
- Role constraints at DB level
- Automatic `edited_at` updates via trigger
- Defensive foreign keys with cascading deletes
